- 'sel' in one of these fields : ['commodity_standardized_fr', 'commodity_standardized2_fr', 'commodity_standardized3_fr', 'commodity_standardized4_fr']

# Aggregation/computation info

- aggregation is done by number of pointcalls and cumulated tonnage
- french/foreign state is decided based on the `homeport_state_1789_fr` field

# Notes/warning

Some boats might not have only salt on board. And they could not be fully filled of salt. So the quantification is highly uncertain, it just gives an order of magnitude.
